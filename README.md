# amenity-reservation-system

An amenity reservation system where users/residents can log in and reserve a time to use a service such as fitness center, pool, or sauna in a hypothetical apartment complex.
Each amenity will have a certain capacity (number of people that can use the service at the same time) so that people can make use of the amenities safely
during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Whole development process and technical decisions has been explained in this tutorial but with **some improvement**:

## Use Cases / User Stories

* Users should be able to log in.
* We will assume that the accounts of residents are pre-created and there will be no sign-up feature.
* Users should be able to view their reservations.
* Users should be able to create new reservations by selecting the amenity type, date, and time.
* Only logged-in users should be able to see the reservations page and create reservations.
* We should check the capacity and only create new reservations if the current number of reservations does not exceed the capacity.
